## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size
- Play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer
- Maintain the state of the score after refreshing the browser _(optional)_
- **Bonus**: Play Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock against the computer _(optional)_
- **Personal Bonus**: To go further, I've decided to offer the user a possibility to switch between classic or "lizard spock" mode. Like the score, the state of the chosen mode is persistent
